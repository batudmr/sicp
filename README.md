# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

This repository contains my weekly homework and lab submissions for CS61A class from UC Berkeley which is taught in Scheme (Lisp). The course itself is based on famous MIT textbook SICP. I didn't take the course from the university. I'm studying it to improve my programming skills and understand programming paradigms.

The exercises files uses .rkt extension instead of .scm because it is easier to install DrRacket to MacOS and Windows and use it as Scheme interpreter.
